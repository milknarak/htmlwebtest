    <h2>Nutrition</h2>

    <p>Dairy products and alternatives such as calcium-fortified soy products 
        are nutritious foods, and provide benefit when consumed as part of a nutritionally 
        balanced diet which includes all of the 5 food groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Breads and cereals</li>
        <li>Vegetables and fruits</li>
        <li>Dairy products/alternatives</li>
        <li>Meat/chicken/fish/alternatives</li>
        <li>A small amount of fats and oils</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The functions of a food are served specifically through 
        its nutritionally important components, including proteins, 
        carbohydrates, lipids, minerals, vitamins and water. Cowâ€™s milk is the preferred 
        choice for most people. It provides 67 kilocalories and has a protein content of 3.2 grams 
        per 100 millilitres. Milk proteins include casein (about 80%) and whey (about 20%). 
        Whey has a higher nutritional value than casein.</p>
