    <p>A production plant for processing dairy products is 
        called a dairy or a dairy factory. Dairy products are generally 
        defined as food products that are produced from milk. 
        They are rich sources of energy. Raw milk for processing generally 
        comes from cows, but occasionally from other mammals such as goats, sheep, and water 
        buffalo. Water is the main constituent of milk (about 90%).</p>
